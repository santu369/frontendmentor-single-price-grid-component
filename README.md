## My process

Experimented with css reset. Worked on mobile layout first and expanded it to desktop layout with a couple of grid styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- SASS
- Parcel

### What I learned

Experimented with css normalize. It makes browsers render elements on the page more consistently rather tn stripping away all the styles like css reset. CSS reset provides much more control on the styling part but everything will have to be written in css whereas normalize makes all browsers render an element with same styling but these will have some padding/margin. If any developer wants to have custome padding/margin, css should be written for those.
I see using reset works fine in these cases.
Used Parcel V2, which is still in beta. Parcel Bundler which was the V1 is no longer maintained.

### Continued development

Will check on browsersync and webpack going forward and also start using bootstrap.
